Okay, that's a crucial finding! If rendering only 10% of the particles didn't significantly speed things up, it confirms that the **bottleneck lies within the simulation calculations themselves** (`sim.simulate` and its constituent functions), not the `CustomPaint` rendering loop.

This is common in complex physics simulations. Now we need to focus on optimizing the Dart code performing the physics calculations.

Here are the options and approaches to speed up the Dart simulation code:

**1. Profiling (Essential First Step)**

*   **What:** Before optimizing blindly, you *must* identify which parts of the simulation are taking the most CPU time.
*   **How:** Use Flutter's DevTools performance profiler.
    *   Run your app in profile mode: `flutter run --profile`
    *   Open DevTools in your browser (link provided in the terminal).
    *   Go to the "Performance" tab.
    *   Start recording, interact with the simulation (let it run for a few seconds, maybe drag the obstacle), and stop recording.
    *   Analyze the "CPU Profiler" results (Bottom-Up, Call Tree, Flame Chart). Look for functions within `FlipFluidSimulation` (like `_stepOnce`, `solveIncompressibility`, `pushParticlesApart`, `transferVelocities`) that consume the highest percentage of "Self Time" or "Total Time".
*   **Why:** This tells you exactly where to focus optimization efforts. Optimizing a function that only takes 1% of the time won't help much. Targeting one that takes 50% will have a huge impact. `solveIncompressibility` and `pushParticlesApart` are often prime candidates in FLIP simulations.

**2. Dart Code Micro-optimizations (Targeted)**

*   Once profiling identifies hotspots:
    *   **Reduce Object Allocation:** Look for places inside tight loops (especially per-particle or per-cell loops) where temporary objects (like `Vector2`) might be created unnecessarily. Try reusing objects or working directly with `dx`, `dy` components. (Your `Vector2` class seems reasonable, but check its usage in loops).
    *   **Minimize Calculations:** Can any expensive operations (like `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`) be calculated less frequently or approximated? Are calculations being repeated unnecessarily within loops?
    *   **Loop Efficiency:** Ensure loop conditions and indexing are efficient. Using `for` loops with integer indices on typed lists is generally fast.
    *   **Cache Lookups:** If you repeatedly access the same calculated value or array element within a loop, consider storing it in a local variable.

**3. Algorithmic Review (Less Likely for Standard FLIP)**

*   Are there any obvious inefficiencies in how algorithms like the spatial hash (`pushParticlesApart`) or the pressure solver (`solveIncompressibility`) are implemented compared to standard practices? (Based on the code, they seem relatively standard, but profiling might reveal specific slow sections within them).

**4. Concurrency with Dart Isolates (Potential, Complex)**

*   **What:** Dart Isolates allow running code on separate threads, potentially parallelizing CPU-bound work.
*   **How:** You could *potentially* parallelize some per-particle loops (`integrateParticles`, `pushParticlesApart`, `transferVelocities`, `updateParticleDensity`). You would need to:
    *   Divide the `numParticles` into chunks.
    *   Spawn Isolates to process each chunk.
    *   Send the necessary data (particle positions, velocities, grid data) to each Isolate (requires copying data, which has overhead).
    *   Receive results back and combine/synchronize them (e.g., summing up grid contributions from different isolates for P2G).
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Data Transfer Overhead:** Sending large amounts of data (particle arrays, grid arrays) back and forth between isolates can be slow and negate the benefits of parallelism. Careful design is needed to minimize this.
    *   **Synchronization:** Ensuring results are combined correctly, especially for grid updates (P2G), requires careful synchronization.
    *   **Complexity:** Managing isolates adds significant complexity to the code structure.
    *   **Pressure Solver:** The iterative nature of `solveIncompressibility` (where each cell depends on its neighbors from the *current or previous iteration*) makes it difficult to parallelize effectively with simple Dart isolates without complex communication patterns.

**5. Native Code with Dart FFI (Highest Potential Speedup, Highest Complexity)**

*   **What:** Rewrite the most computationally intensive parts of the simulation (identified by profiling, likely `solveIncompressibility`, `pushParticlesApart`, `transferVelocities`) in a language like C, C++, or Rust, compile them into a native library, and call them from Dart using `dart:ffi`.
*   **How:**
    *   Identify the bottleneck function(s).
    *   Rewrite their logic in C/C++/Rust, operating directly on pointers to the underlying memory of the `Float32List`/`Int32List` data passed from Dart.
    *   Compile this native code into a shared library (`.so` on Android/Linux, `.dylib` on macOS/iOS, `.dll` on Windows).
    *   Use the `dart:ffi` library in Dart to load the native library and define function bindings to call the native code, passing the necessary data pointers.
*   **Why:** Native compiled code (especially C/C++/Rust) often significantly outperforms Dart for heavy numerical computation, as it allows for lower-level memory manipulation and platform-specific SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimizations that Dart's compiler might not achieve.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   Requires knowledge of C/C++/Rust and native build systems (CMake, NDK for Android, etc.).
    *   Adds complexity to your build process.
    *   Debugging native code called via FFI can be more difficult.
    *   Need to carefully manage memory and data pointers between Dart and native code.

**6. External Optimized Libraries? (Unlikely for this Specific Task)**

*   There aren't readily available, popular Dart libraries specifically designed for highly optimized FLIP fluid simulations that you could just drop in. General physics engines (like Forge or Flame's physics components) usually focus on rigid bodies or simpler particle systems and wouldn't replace your custom FLIP grid logic. Numerical libraries in Dart are not as mature or optimized as Python's NumPy/SciPy.
*   Therefore, relying on external libraries is *not* a likely solution here; optimization will likely involve your own code or FFI.

**7. Parameter Reduction (The Workaround)**

*   This is the simplest "fix": Reduce `particleCount`, increase `spacing` (lower grid resolution), decrease `numPressureIters`. This directly reduces the simulation workload but compromises detail/quality.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Profile First:** Absolutely critical. Don't guess where the slowdown is. Use DevTools.
2.  **Target Hotspots:** Focus optimization efforts (Micro-optimizations, FFI) on the functions identified by the profiler. `solveIncompressibility` is a very common bottleneck.
3.  **Consider FFI:** If profiling shows a huge amount of time spent in a few core numerical loops, FFI is the most promising path for significant speedups, despite the added complexity. You could start by porting just the single most expensive function (e.g., one iteration of the pressure solve loop) to native code.
4.  **Evaluate Isolates Carefully:** Explore Isolates only if profiling suggests easily parallelizable per-particle loops are the main issue *and* you can manage the data transfer overhead.

Given that rendering wasn't the issue, optimizing the core simulation loop via **profiling + targeted micro-optimizations** or, more likely for substantial gains, **profiling + FFI** for the heaviest parts, are your main paths forward.

# Vectorization ideas

That's a great line of thinking! Exploiting vectorization (SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is precisely how high-performance numerical code gets significant speedups on modern CPUs. The idea is to perform the same operation (like addition or multiplication) on multiple pieces of data (e.g., 4, 8, or even 16 floats) simultaneously with a single CPU instruction.

However, **directly using vectorization libraries or rewriting algorithms in a vectorized format *within pure Dart* is currently challenging and generally not the standard approach.**

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Lack of Stable, High-Level SIMD in Dart SDK:**
    *   Dart used to have an experimental `dart:simd` library that provided types like `Float32x4`, `Int32x4`, etc., and operations on them. However, this library **was deprecated and is not part of the stable Dart SDK.** It wasn't widely adopted and presented maintenance challenges.
    *   Therefore, you cannot simply import a standard library and rewrite your loops using explicit SIMD types directly in Dart like you might in some other ecosystems.

2.  **Dart Ecosystem Libraries:**
    *   There isn't a widely adopted, mature numerical computing library for Dart that provides NumPy-like functionality with transparent, high-performance SIMD acceleration *implemented purely in Dart*.
    *   Libraries like `vector_math` are excellent for graphics (Vector2, Vector3, Matrix4) but operate on small, fixed-size types and aren't designed for large-scale array processing with SIMD.
    *   Most attempts at high-performance numerical tasks in Dart libraries often resort to wrapping native code via FFI themselves.

3.  **How SIMD *is* Leveraged with Dart:**
    *   **Implicitly via Compiler:** The Dart AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compiler *can* perform some level of auto-vectorization for simple loops operating on `dart:typed_data` (like `Float32List`), especially when compiling to native machine code. However, the extent and reliability of this automatic optimization can vary and often doesn't match what's achievable with explicit control.
    *   **Explicitly via FFI (The Recommended Way):** This is the standard and most effective method. You identify the performance-critical loops (using profiling!) and rewrite them in C, C++, or Rust.
        *   **Native Auto-Vectorization:** Modern C/C++/Rust compilers (GCC, Clang, Rustc) are often very good at auto-vectorizing loops when optimization flags are enabled (e.g., `-O3`, `-march=native`). You write standard C/C++/Rust loops operating on the data arrays passed from Dart (via pointers), and the compiler handles generating SIMD instructions.
        *   **Native SIMD Intrinsics:** For maximum control and performance, you can use explicit SIMD intrinsics within your C/C++/Rust code (e.g., SSE/AVX intrinsics on x86, NEON intrinsics on ARM). This gives you direct access to the CPU's vector instructions but requires more platform-specific code.
        *   You then call this compiled native function from Dart using `dart:ffi`.

**"Vectorizing" Your Algorithm - The FFI Approach:**

So, while you can't directly use a "vectorization library" in Dart, you *can* achieve the benefits of vectorization via FFI:

1.  **Profile:** Identify the slowest loops (e.g., inner loops of `solveIncompressibility`, `pushParticlesApart`, `transferVelocities`).
2.  **Choose Native Language:** C, C++, or Rust are good choices.
3.  **Rewrite Hotspot(s) in Native Code:**
    *   Take the logic of the bottleneck loop.
    *   Write a C/C++/Rust function that accepts pointers to the relevant Dart `Float32List`/`Int32List` data buffers (e.g., `particlePos`, `particleVel`, `u`, `v`, `p`, `s`).
    *   Implement the loop logic in the native language. Aim for simple array traversals that the compiler can easily auto-vectorize, or use explicit SIMD intrinsics if needed.
    *   **Example Idea (Pressure Solve Inner Loop):** The inner `i` and `j` loops in `solveIncompressibility` perform neighbor lookups and simple arithmetic (additions, subtractions, multiplications). This structure is often amenable to vectorization, especially if you process rows or columns in chunks that fit SIMD registers.
    *   **Example Idea (Particle Loops):** Loops over `numParticles` in `pushParticlesApart` or `transferVelocities` perform similar calculations on `particlePos[2*i]`, `particlePos[2*i+1]`, etc. These could potentially be vectorized to process multiple particles' coordinates or velocities at once in the native code.
4.  **Compile Native Code:** Create a shared library (`.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll`). Ensure compiler optimizations (`-O3`) and appropriate architecture flags are enabled.
5.  **Create FFI Bindings:** Use `dart:ffi` to load the library and call your native function(s), passing the `.data` pointers from your Dart typed lists.

**Conclusion:**

Forget looking for a pure Dart vectorization library for this task. The path forward for significant SIMD-based speedup involves **profiling** to find the bottlenecks and then using **Dart FFI** to call optimized native code (C, C++, Rust) where the actual vectorization (either automatic by the native compiler or manual using intrinsics) happens. This is more complex but offers the highest performance potential.
