# Project Status Summary (Water Slosher - 2025-04-28)

This document summarizes the current state of the Water Slosher Flutter project after recent debugging and refinement sessions.

**Project Overview:**
  
The project implements a 2D fluid simulation using the FLIP (Fluid Implicit Particle) method. Key components are:

*   **Simulation Core (`lib/simulation/flip_fluid_simulation.dart`):** Handles physics calculations (particle movement, gravity via sensors, particle interactions, grid transfers, pressure solving, collisions).
*   **Rendering (`lib/rendering/particle_renderer.dart`):** Draws particles and optional grid using `CustomPaint`.
*   **UI & Controls (`lib/ui/simulation_screen.dart`):** Main screen, touch input handling, simulation display, and parameter controls.

**Issues Addressed:**

1.  **Particle Count Limitation:**
    *   **Problem:** Simulation capped particles below the UI limit (~5000).
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient `maxParticles` allocation and small initial fluid block size.
    *   **Fixes:** Increased `maxParticles` (UI: L42, L75), expanded slider range (UI: L253), enlarged initial block size (UI: L84-86).
    *   **Status:** Resolved.

2.  **Instability (Jitter, Energy Gain):**
    *   **Problem:** Jittery motion and apparent energy gain in dense/high-velocity scenarios.
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient damping, simple collision responses, pressure solver oscillations.
    *   **Fixes (`lib/simulation/flip_fluid_simulation.dart`):** Reduced over-relaxation (UI: L393), increased viscosity (Sim: L561), added velocity clamping (Sim: L159-164), implemented inelastic wall collisions (Sim: L274-287), implemented inelastic particle-particle collisions (Sim: L226-233).
    *   **Status:** Significantly improved stability.

**Remaining Challenges / Considerations:**

1.  **Energy/Momentum Conservation:**
    *   **Issue:** Not strictly conserved due to intentional damping (restitution < 1.0), viscosity, and numerical methods prioritizing stability.
    *   **Code:** `handleParticleCollisions`, `pushParticlesApart`, `applyViscosity`, `integrateParticles` (Sim).
    *   **Status:** Accepted trade-off for stability in real-time simulation.

2.  **Performance:**
    *   **Issue:** Frame rate may drop with high particle counts due to computational load (particle interactions, pressure solving).
    *   **Code:** Primarily methods in `lib/simulation/flip_fluid_simulation.dart`.
    *   **Status:** Inherent challenge; optimization requires advanced techniques.

3.  **Parameter Tuning:**
    *   **Issue:** Behavior is sensitive to parameters; finding the ideal balance requires experimentation.
    *   **Code:** `SimOptions` (UI) applied in `lib/simulation/flip_fluid_simulation.dart`.
    *   **Status:** Current parameters offer reasonable stability; further tuning possible.

**Conclusion:**

The core issues regarding particle limits and major instabilities have been addressed. The simulation is now more robust and capable of handling higher particle counts, albeit with performance considerations and the accepted trade-off regarding strict energy conservation.
