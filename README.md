# Slosh O'Clock wearOS App

An interactive fluid dynamics simulation demonstration for Wear OS devices with accelerometers and touch inputs, serving as a testbed for AI-assisted code development, primarily utilizing Gemini 2.5 Pro.

## Acknowledgements

This project is adapted to Flutter and wearOS based on the original html demo of FLIP water simulation by Matthias MÃ¼ller:
